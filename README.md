# Quantigration-RMA

This is a college project for the course "Introduction to Structured Databases Environment" (DAD-220). The goals of this project are:

1. Create a structured database through the use of relational concepts
2. Implement basic processing functionalities to create new structured database environments
3. Analyze the results of queries constructed to address data requirements

## Scenario 1: Creating Database

The project is structured in an real world based scenario where the I am a database administrator for a company called Quantigration.

### Scenario:

You’re working as a database administrator for Quantigration, a networking equipment manufacturer. The company has grown quickly and is still figuring out its internal business processes. The company uses customer return merchandise authorizations (RMAs) to track shipments for defective or incorrect parts. The company has identified RMAs as a specific problematic area.

Your supervisor at Quantigration asked you to create a database for a new software application that will be used for processing RMAs. The application must also record where items are received because merchandise can be taken in at several locations. This system will also capture where the equipment is going next. Options include repair, scrap, or refurbishing and resale. The warehouse shipping and receiving employees at your company will be using this application. These employees are considered your end users for the application. Part of their job is to process customer return shipments.

A set of instructions were given to complete this section of the project click [here](<Carlos Bracho - Project One.docx>) to open first part of this project.

## Scenario 2: Analyszing Results

In this second scenario I was asked to analize results and present them.

### Scenario:

The product manager of Quantigration has asked your data analytics team for a report summarizing your analysis of the return merchandise authorizations (RMAs) received. You will be working with the same data sets that you have already been working with. Your report should summarize the analysis and present your findings to the product manager. Some of the people who will review this report don’t have a technical background.

## Skills Learned

This project allowed me to learn how to work with databases using MySQL, which is an essential tool for any programmer or developer that works with data. I especifically learned:

1. Learned how to design a databases using the help of an ERD.
2. Gained experience defining tables to store specific data categories, such as customers, orders, or items.
3. Explored how to establish relationships between these tables to connect related pieces of data.
4. Learned techniques to manipulate databases such as adding, removing, or changing elements within a database to adapt it to evolving needs.
5. Learned to translate data to a non-techinical audience.
6. Practiced using queries to extract valuable information from the database, such as trends, patterns, or summaries.
